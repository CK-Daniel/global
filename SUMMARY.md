# Project Restructuring Summary

## Completed Steps

1. **File Organization**
   - Moved files from wp-content/themes/Divi to:
     - js/divi, css/divi, fonts/divi, img/divi
   - Moved files from wp-content/themes/kueppersbusch to:
     - js/, css/, fonts/, img/
   - Moved files from wp-content/plugins to plugins/
   - Ensured uploads are in assets/uploads

2. **Path Updates**
   - Updated all CSS paths in HTML files
   - Updated all JS paths in HTML files
   - Updated font references
   - Updated image references
   - Fixed full URL references (https://www.home-kueppersbusch.com/global/wp-content/...)
   - Created compatibility links for backward compatibility

3. **Documentation**
   - Created DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md with explanation of new structure
   - Created reorganization plan documenting the strategy

## Remaining Issues

There are still a few wp-content references in some HTML files. These appear to be:

1. **In-content references**
   - Some references in JSON data in JavaScript blocks
   - Some deeply nested relative path references
   - Some dynamically generated content that may have hardcoded paths

2. **Specific Files with Remaining References**
   - service/manuals/index.html
   - history/index.html
   - new-energy-label/index.html

## Recommendations for Complete Cleanup

1. **Manual Review**
   - Examine the remaining files with wp-content references
   - Make targeted fixes for the specific patterns found

2. **Testing**
   - Test the site functionality to ensure all assets load correctly
   - Use browser developer tools to identify any 404 errors for assets

3. **Long-term Strategy**
   - Once all references are updated, the wp-content directory can be safely removed
   - Maintain the compatibility symlinks for a transition period
   - Consider adding CI checks to prevent new wp-content references

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Simplified Paths** - All asset paths are shorter and more intuitive
2. **Improved Organization** - Assets are organized by type rather than by WordPress structure
3. **Non-WordPress Compatibility** - Site structure no longer requires WordPress knowledge to navigate
4. **Future-Proofing** - Structure is independent of the CMS and more portable
